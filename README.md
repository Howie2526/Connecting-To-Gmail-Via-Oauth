# Connecting-To-Gmail-Via-Oauth

Hello, we are in the process of creating a php script to connect from a server to Gmail securely via Oauth. Actually it's a 100% working script but there are ways we are looking to improve it. If you are more knowledgeable than us, and would like to contribute, please do. Anything you can recommend, whether it be an improvement in speed, best practice, efficiency or something else, please do not hesitate to assist.

Whether you assist in improving this script or simply use it on your own website, that is fine too.

A little more about us, we are a legally registered not for profit organization in Canada, The Canadian Disability Union, meaning we have little to no funds. If you find this script helps you in anyway, all we ask is you either help improve it or consider making a small donation of $5 and I emphasize consider, it is not a requirement, feel free to use it either way, thank you.

Please note, this is a 100% fully functional working script and will securely connect to Gmail using SMTP, OAUTH and PHP.
In order for it to sucessfully work, you must have PHPMailer correctly installed on your server, you must have OAUTH correctly enabled via GMail with a clientID and clientSecret. Your server must also allow port 587, if all three of those things are not done, this script will not work. I actually had to threaten to switch hosting providers before my hosting provider agreed to unblock port 587.

I will post more later on how to correctly set up PHPMailer, oauth and how to identify if your server blocks port 587.
